# Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of a car based on user input such as company name, car model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven. It uses a Linear Regression model for prediction.


## Input Features

- Company Name: The name of the car company.
- Car Model: The model of the car.
- Year: The year of the car model.
- Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric).
- Kilometers Driven: The number of kilometers driven by the car.


## Model

- The prediction is based on a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset of car prices and their corresponding features. The model takes into account the various features of the car to estimate its price.
